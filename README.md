This project implements an image compression algorithm inspired by the Kolmogorov–Arnold representation theorem.

- Fourier Features - mapping input coordinates into a sinusoidal feature space to enhance network learning.
- Perceptual Loss - using a pre-trained VGG16 network to preserve high-quality visual features in the reconstructed image.
- Adversarial Training - using a discriminator to improve the realism of the reconstructed image.
- Post-Processing - functions for super-resolution, denoising, contrast enhancement, and JPEG compression evaluation (using PSNR and SSIM).
